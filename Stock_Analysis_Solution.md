## How to read the solutions

In each year's screenshot, columns **A** to **G** are the source data. Columns **I** to **L** are the basic analysis done to identify the *Yearly Change*, *Percent Change* and *Total Stock Volume* of each *Ticker*. In Column **J** (the *Yearly Change* column), conditional formatting is used to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

Columns **O** to **Q** are the advanced analysis to summarize the changes based on the first analysis. In here, VBA codes are used to identify the **greatest % increase**, **greatest % decrease** and **greatest total volume** of each year.
